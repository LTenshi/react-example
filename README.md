# Turborepo Monorepo based React example with a Nest.js Backend

This repository is meant to showcase my ability to pivot and work with React based SPAs

It will be updated over time with new examples. Check the bottom of this readme for a list.

# How to run

### Note for developers or individuals familiar with development
I used [Bun](https://bun.sh) during development and opted to have NPM as a default, but in theory if you know what you are doing you should be able to use PNPM and Yarn with some minor tweaking of the package.json packageManager field.

## Step one:
Clone the repository to the folder of your choice

## Step two:
âš  If you plan to stick with NPM for simplicity, skip this step âš \
\
If you'd like to run Bun, rename package.json to package.json.disabled and package.json.disabled2 to package.json.

## Step three:
Use any of the following commands depending on the package manager of your choice..
><b>npm i</b>\
bun i

Once the installation was finished

## Step four:
>npm run dev\
bun run dev

The application should then be hosted on the following two adresses

http://localhost:3000 - Client\
http://localhost:3001 - API
