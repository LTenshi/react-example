# Turborepo Monorepo based React example with a Nest.js Backend

This repository is meant to showcase my ability to pivot and work with React based SPAs

It will be updated over time with new examples. Check the bottom of this readme for a list.

# How to run
Clone the repository and install with the package manager of your choice.\
I used [Bun](https://bun.sh), but in theory you should be able to use NPM, PNPM and Yarn with some minor warnings on initial install.

Step one:\
Clone the repository to the folder of your choice

Step two:\
Use any of the following commands depending on the package manager of your choice. (Bun was used in development so it will work out of the gate).
><b>npm i</b>\
pnpm i\
bun i

Once the installation was finished

Step 3:
>npm run dev\
pnpm run dev\
bun run dev

The application should then be hosted on the following two adresses

http://localhost:3000 - Client\
http://localhost:3001 - API
