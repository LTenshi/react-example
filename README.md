# Turborepo Monorepo based React example with a Nest.js Backend

This repository is meant to showcase my ability to pivot and work with React based SPAs

It will be updated over time with new examples. Check the bottom of this readme for a list.

# How to run

## Step one:

Clone the repository to the folder of your choice

## Step two:

Go into the directory, open command line/open the folder as project in vscode and run:

> npm i

You may see an installation prompt from playwright, if you are keen to see the tests running, please accept whatever it asks for. Otherwise you can see the last test result from the playwright-report folder inside of the apps/frontend/playwright-folder and open it in the browser of your choice.

## Step three:

Once the installation is finished

> npm run dev

The application should then be hosted on the following two adresses

http://localhost:3000 - Client\
http://localhost:3001 - API\
http://localhost:3001/api-docs - Swagger API Docs
